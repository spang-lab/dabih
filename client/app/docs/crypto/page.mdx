## Summary

- Symmetric Algorithm: 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard with Cipher Block Chaining, AES-256-CBC, specified in NIST SP800-38A.
- Asymmetric Algorithm: 4096 bit Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), specified in RFC3447.
- Hashing Algorithm: 256-bit SHA (SHA-256) as specified in FIPS 180-4.
- During file upload the dataset is processed in memory and not written to disk.
- When the upload starts the server generates a cryptographically strong pseudo-random AES-256-CBC Key k (24 Bytes)
- The client creates “chunks”, sequential byte buffers of the data, each with size 2 MiB.
- For each chunk we again generate a cryptographically strong pseudo-random initialization vector (iv)
- The raw chunk data is hashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the AES key k with the initialization vector iv
- We then create a crc32 checksum of the encrypted chunk.
- This encrypted chunk is then written to the file system and the iv, hash and checksum written to the database.
- All the asymmetric keys are RSA key-pairs, with at least 4096 bits.
