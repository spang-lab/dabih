# Installation

Desktop application for dabih

1. First of all you need a link to the user-specific download-page. There are two ways to get one:
    - You can get your own [account](/docs) and go to the *Upload Token* button in the *Settings* menu and copy that url to a new tab. For that **you need an account**.
    - You probably want to use one of our upload tokens so you will just get a link and open that in your browser. For that **you don't need an account**.
2. To get the *dabih desktop application* download the corresponding installer for your operating system.
3. The client will guide you through the installation process. You will need administrator privileges for that.
4. Once this is done you can enter an *upload token*:
    - This can either be your own, if you want to *upload to your own storage*. You can generate your own in the *settings* section on the webpage for which **you will need an [account](/docs)**.
    - In most cases, however, you will just use one of our upload tokens. In this case **you don't need an account**.
5. You're ready! Now you can just select if you want to upload single files or whole directories and select them in your explorer. If you choose the *zip* option the program will automatically
zip (compressing into a smaller folder for better exchange) your folder for you.
6. NOTE: If you use a *Aperio ScanScope* scanner by *Leica Biosystems*, your scan consists of two parts: one `.mrxs` file and a folder with the same name. You will need to upload both;
one as a file and the other as zipped folder.
